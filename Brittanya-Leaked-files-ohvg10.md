In 2019, Brittanya ventured into creating adult content, selling webcam sessions and explicit photos. This move escalated her controversy, with critics expressing concerns over the sexualization of her young audience. She has faced bans and restrictions on various platforms due to her explicit content. Brittanya's breakthrough exhibition came in 2015, when she showcased her work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition, titled "Reflections," featured a series of large-scale paintings that explored the theme of self-reflection. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, with many art critics praising Brittanya's unique artistic vision and her ability to connect with viewers on a deep emotional level.
